staley2017  Implements the logistic regression models presented in Staley et al., 2017
----------
BACKGROUND:
This module solves the logistic regression models presented in Staley et al., 2017 
(see citation below). These models describe debris-flow probability as a function 
of terrain (T), fire burn severity (F), soil (S), and rainfall accumulation (R),
such that:

    p = e^X / (1 + e^X)                  Equation 1
    
    X = B + Ct*T*R + Cf*F*R + Cs*S*R

where:
    p is the probability of a debris flow
    T is a terrain variable
    F is a fire severity variable
    S is a soil variable
    R is rainfall accumulation in mm/hour
    B is a model intercept, and
    Ct, Cf, Cs are variable coefficients

The paper details 4 specific probability models, each of which uses a different 
combination of earth-system variables as T, F, and S.

MODULE OVERVIEW:
This module provides two functions that solve models of this form in the forward
and reverse directions. The "probability" function solves the model in the forward
direction - this computes debris-flow probability as a function of rainfall
accumulation using Equation 1.

By contrast, the "accumulation" function determines the rainfall accumulation
needed to cause a debris flow at the specified probability levels. This function
inverts Equation 1, such that:

    R = [ln(p / (1-p)) - B] / (Ct*T + Cf*F + Cs*S)

Both functions can solve for multiple stream segments, parameter values, probability
thresholds, and rainfall accumulations simultaneously. Note that these functions
are generic solvers - as such, they are suitable for any of the 4 models described
in the paper, as well as for any custom models following the form of Equation 1.

In addition to the generic solvers, this module provides the M1, M2, M3, and M4 
model classes, which provide additional support for implementing the 4 specific
models described in the paper. Each class provides a "parameters" method, which 
returns the corresponding B, Ct, Cf, and Cs values published in the paper. Each 
class also provides a "variables" method, which returns the appropriate T, F, 
and S variables for a given set of stream segments. These parameters and variables
can then be used to run the "probability" and/or "accumulation" functions.

EXAMPLE:
This example demonstrates how to use the M1 model to solve for debris-flow
probability and rainfall accumulation. First, use the M1 class to obtain the
parameters and variables needed to implement this model:

    >>> from pfdf.models import staley2017 as s17
    >>> B, Ct, Cf, Cs = s17.M1.parameters()
    >>> T, F, S = s17.M1.variables(segments, <other args>)

Note that the first input to any model's "variables" method is always a 
pfdf.segments.Segments describing a particular stream segment network. The subsequent
inputs will vary, as each model is calibrated to a different set of earth
system variables.
    
Then, to solve for probability given rainfall accumulations:

    >>> R = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3]
    >>> p = s17.probability(R, B, Ct, T, Cf, F, Cs, S)

Or to solve for accumulation given probabilities:

    >>> p = [0.5, 0.75]
    >>> R = s17.accumulation(p, B, Cr, T, Cf, F, Cs, S)

NOTE ON RASTER SHAPES:
Each model's "variables" method uses a pfdf.segments.Segments object to
calculate values from various input rasters. As such, the associated input rasters
must always match the raster shape, crs, and (affine) transform associated with the
stream segment raster.

DESIGNING NEW MODELS:
Advanced users may be interested in implementing new models that follow the form
of Equation 1. Because the "probability" and "accumulation" functions are generalized,
you can them to implement these model variants - to do so, provide the custom
coefficients and variables to a function, and run as usual.

    accumulation  Computes rainfall accumulations needed for specified debris-flow probability levels
    ----------
    accumulation(p, B, Ct, T, Cf, F, Cs, S)
    Returns the rainfall accumulations required to achieve the specified p-values.
    This function is agnostic to the actual model being run, and thus can
    implement all 4 of the models presented in the paper (as well as any other
    model following the form of Equation 1).

    All of the inputs to this function should be real-valued numpy arrays.
    The three variables - T, F, and S - represent the terrain steepness,
    wildfire severity, and surface properties variables for the model. In
    most cases, these are 1D arrays with one element per stream segment
    being assessed. Variables can also be 2D arrays - see below for details
    for this less common use case.

    The four parameters - B, Ct, Cf, and Cs - are the parameters of the logistic
    model link equation. B is the intercept, and each C parameter
    is the coefficient of the associated variable. The parameters should be
    numpy 1D arrays with one element per run of the hazard assessment model.
    Here, we define a "run" as an implementation of the hazard model using a
    unique set of logistic model parameters. A common use case is solving the
    model for multiple rainfall durations (for example, 15, 30, and 60 minute
    intervals). In the example with 3 durations, each parameter should have
    3 elements - each element corresponds to the parameter value appropriate
    for a particular rainfall duration. Another use case for multiple runs
    is for Monte Carlo validation of one or more model parameters.

    The p-values - p - are the probabilities for which the model should be solved.
    For example, p=0.5 solves for the rainfall intensities that cause a 50%
    likelihood of a debris-flow. p should be a 1D array listing all the
    probabilities that should be solved for.

    This function solves the rainfall accumulations for all stream segments,
    parameter runs, and p-values provided. Each accumulation describes the total
    rainfall required within the rainfall duration associated with its parameters.
    For example, if using parameters for a 15-minute rainfall duration, the accumulation
    describes the total rainfall required within a 15-minute window. Accumulation
    units are the units of the rainfall values used to calibrate the model's parameters.
    For the 4 models described in the paper, accumulations are in mm.

    The returned output will be a 3D numpy array. The first dimension is
    stream segments, second dimension is parameter runs, and third dimension is
    p-values. If only a single p-value is provided, the output is returned as a
    2D array. If there is a single parameter run and a single p-value, then output
    is returned as a 1D array. (Or see below for an option that always returns a 3D array).

    As mentioned, one or more variable can also be a 2D array. In this case
    each row is a stream segment, and each column is a parameter run. Each
    column will be used to solve the model for (only) the associated parameter
    run. This allows use of different values for a variable. An example use
    case could be testing the model using different datasets to derive one or
    more variables.

    accumulation(..., *, always_3d = True)
    Always returns the output as a 3D numpy array, regardless of the number
    of p-values and parameter runs.

    being assessed. Variables can also be 2D arrays - see below for details
    for this less common use case.

    The four parameters - B, Ct, Cf, and Cs - are the parameters of the logistic
    model link equation. B is the intercept, and each C parameter
    is the coefficient of the associated variable. The parameters should be
    numpy 1D arrays with one element per run of the hazard assessment model.
    Here, we define a "run" as an implementation of the hazard model using a
    unique set of logistic model parameters. A common use case is solving the
    model for multiple rainfall durations (for example, 15, 30, and 60 minute
    intervals). In the example with 3 durations, each parameter should have
    3 elements - each element corresponds to the parameter value appropriate
    for a particular rainfall duration. Another use case for multiple runs
    is for Monte Carlo validation of one or more model parameters.

    The p-values - p - are the probabilities for which the model should be solved.
    For example, p=0.5 solves for the rainfall intensities that cause a 50%
    likelihood of a debris-flow. p should be a 1D array listing all the
    probabilities that should be solved for.

    This function solves the rainfall accumulations for all stream segments,
    parameter runs, and rainfall accumulations provided. Note that rainfall
    accumulations should be relative to the rainfall durations associated with
    each set of parameters. For example, if using parameters for 15-minute and
    30-minute rainfall durations, then input accumulations should be for 15-minute
    and 30-minute intervals, respectively. Accumulation units are the units of the
    rainfall values used to calibrate the model's parameters. For the 4 models
    described in the paoer, accumulations are in mm.

    The returned output will be a 3D numpy array. The first dimension is
    stream segments, second dimension is parameter runs, and third dimension is
    queried rainfall accumulations. If only a single accumulation is provided,
    the output is returned as a 2D array. If there is a single parameter run and
    a single rainfall accumulation, then output is returned as a 1D array. (Or
    see below for an option that always returns a 3D array).

    As mentioned, one or more variable can also be a 2D array. In this case
    each row is a stream segment, and each column is a parameter run. Each
    column will be used to solve the model for (only) the associated parameter
    run. This allows use of different values for a variable. An example use
