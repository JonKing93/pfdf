staley2017  Implements the logistic regression models presented in Staley et al., 2017
----------
This module solves the logistic regression models presented in Staley et al., 2017 
(see citation below) - specifically, these are logistic models of form:

    R = [ln(p / (1-p)) - B] / (Ct*T + Cf*F + Cs*S)          Equation 1

where:
  p is the probability of an event
  B is the model intercept
  T is a terrain variable
  F is a wildfire variable
  S is a soil variable, and
  Ct, Cf, Cs are variable coefficients

The solution of the model (R) is the rainfall accumulation needed to cause a debris-flow
at the specified probability level. The "solve" function provides a generalized
solution to logistic models of this form, and can solve for multiple stream segments,
parameter values, and probability thresholds simultaneously.

The M1, M2, M3, and M4 model classes provide additional support for implementing
the four specific models described in the paper. Each class provides a "parameters"
method, which returns the appropriate B, Ct, Cf, and Cs values published in the paper. 
Each class also provides a "variables" method, which returns the T, F, and S
variables for a given set of stream segments. For example, to obtain the terms for
the M1 model, use:

    >>> from pfdf.models import staley2017 as s17
    >>> parameters = s17.M1.parameters()
    >>> variables = s17.M1.variables(...)

Note that the outputs of the "parameters" and "variables" methods are dicts whose
keys are the corresponding terms of the model. Continuing the example:

    >>> B, Ct, Cf, Cs = parameters.values()
    >>> T, F, S = variables.values()

We re-emphasize that the "solve" function provides a general solutiofn to Equation
1, so users are not required to use any of the M1-4 models. Rather, they are
a convenience for common use cases. We recommend users read a model's documentation
for additional details on its implementation and use.

NOTE ON RASTER SHAPES:
Many commands in this module compute values for a set of stream segments using
various input rasters. When this is the case, the shape of the input rasters
should match the shape of the stream raster used to define the segments.

DESIGNING NEW MODELS:
Advanced users may be interested in implementing new models that follow the form
of Equation 1. Because the "solve" function is generalized, you can use it to
implement these model variants - to do so, provide the updated coefficients
and/or variables to the function, and run as usual.

Such users may also be interested in the "burn_gradient", "kf_factor", "ruggedness", 
"scaled_dnbr", "scaled_thickness", and "upslope_ratio" functions. These lower-level
functions are used to calculate the individual variables for the M1-4 models, and
may faciliate the calculation of variables for model variants. We note that
"upslope_ratio" is generalizable to a number of variables, including M1-T, M2-F,
and M4-T. Also note that each of these functions computes values over a set of
stream segments.

    solve  Computes rainfall accumulations by solving the logistic model from Staley et al., 2017
    ----------
    solve(p, B, Ct, T, Cf, F, Cs, S)
    Solves the logistic model from Staley et al., 2017 (Equation 5). Returns
    the rainfall accumulations required to achieve the specified p-values.
    This function is agnostic to the actual model being run, and thus can
    implement all 4 of the models presented in the paper (as well as any other
    model following the form of Equation 5).

    All of the inputs to this function should be real-valued numpy arrays.
    The three variables - T, F, and S - represent the terrain steepness,
    wildfire severity, and surface properties variables for the model. In
    most cases, these are 1D arrays with one element per stream segment
    being assessed. Variables can also be 2D arrays - see below for details
    for this less common use case.

    The four parameters - B, Ct, Cf, and Cs - are the parameters of the logistic
    model link equation (Equation 4). B is the intercept, and each C parameter
    is the coefficient of the associated variable. The parameters should be
    numpy 1D arrays with one element per run of the hazard assessment model.
    Here, we define a "run" as an implementation of the hazard model using a
    unique set of logistic model parameters. A common use case is solving the
    model for multiple rainfall durations (for example, 15, 30, and 60 minute
    intervals). In the example with 3 durations, each parameter should have
    3 elements - each element corresponds to the parameter value appropriate
    for a particular rainfall duration. Another use case for multiple runs
    is for Monte Carlo validation of one or more model parameters.

    The p-values - p - are the probabilities for which the model should be solved.
    For example, p=0.5 solves for the rainfall intensities that cause a 50%
    likelihood of a debris-flow. p should be a 1D array listing all the
    probabilities that should be solved for.

    This function solves the rainfall accumulations for all stream segments,
    parameter runs, and p-values provided. Each accumulation describes the total
    rainfall required within the rainfall duration associated with its parameters.
    For example, if using parameters for a 15-minute rainfall duration, the accumulation
    describes the total rainfall required within a 15-minute window. Accumulation
    units are the units of the rainfall values used to calibrate the model's parameters.
    For the 4 models described in the paper, accumulations are in mm.

    The returned output will be a 3D numpy array. The first dimension is
    stream segments, second dimension is parameter runs, and third dimension is
    p-values. If only a single p-value is provided, the output is returned as a
    2D array. If there is a single parameter run and a single p-value, then output
    is returned as a 1D array. (And see below for an option that always returns a 3D array).

    As mentioned, one or more variable can also be a 2D array. In this case
    each row is a stream segment, and each column is a parameter run. Each
    column will be used to solve the model for (only) the associated parameter
    run. This allows use of different values for a variable. An example use
    case could be testing the model using different datasets to derive one or
    more variables.

    solve(..., *, always_3d = True)
    Always returns the output as a 3D numpy array, regardless of the number
    of p-values and parameter runs.
