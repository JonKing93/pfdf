"""
Acquire data from NOAA Atlas 14
----------
This module provides functions to access precipitation frequency estimates (PFEs) from
NOAA Atlas 14. Most users will want to use the `download` command, which returns a .csv
file with PFEs at a given lat-lon coordinate. This module also provides commands that
return API URLs, which advanced users may find useful for generating custom queries.
----------
Data:
    download    - Downloads a .csv file of precipitation frequency estimates for a coordinate

URLs:
    base_url    - Returns the base URL for the NOAA Atlas 14 data API
    query_url   - Returns the URL used to query NOAA Atlas 14 for a specific PFE statistic

Internal:
    _validate_statistic - Checks a PFE statistic is valid

    Downloads a .csv file with precipitation frequency estimates for a given point
    ----------
    download(lat, lon)
    Downloads a .csv file with precipitation frequency estimates for the given point.
    The `lat` and `lon` coordinates should be provided in decimal degrees, and `lon`
    should be on the interval [-180, 180]. By default, downloads mean PFEs of
    precipitation intensity for partial duration time series. See below for alternative
    options.

    Returns the path to the downloaded csv file as output. By default, this command will
    download the dataset to the current folder, and the data file will be named
    "noaa-atlas14-mean-pds-intensity.csv". Raises an error if the file already exists.
    (And see the following syntax for additional file options).

    download(..., *, parent)
    download(..., *, name)
    download(..., *, overwrite=True)
    Options for downloading the file. Use the `parent` input to specify the the path to
    the parent folder where the file should be saved. If a relative path, then parent is
    interpreted relative to the current folder. Use `name` to set the name of the
    downloaded file. By default, raises an error if the path for the downloaded file
    already exists. Set overwrite=True to allow the download to overwrite an existing
    file.

    download(..., *, statistic)
    download(..., *, data)
    download(..., *, series)
    download(..., *, units)
    Specify the type of data that should be downloaded. Supported values are as follows:

    *Statistic*
    mean: Mean PFE values (default)
    upper: Upper bound of the 90% confidence interval
    lower: Lower bound of the 90% confidence interval
    all: Mean, upper, and lower

    *Data*
    intensity: Values are precipitation intensities (default)
    depth: Values are precipitation depths

    *Series*
    pds: PFEs estimated from partial duration time series (default)
    ams: PFEs estimated from annual maximum time series

    *Units*
    metric: PFEs returned in mm or mm/hour (default)
    english: PFEs returned in inches or inches/hour

    Note that if you do not specify a path for the downloaded file, then the download
    file will follow the naming scheme: "noaa-atlas14-<statistic>-<series>-<data>-<units>.csv"

    download(..., *, timeout)
    Specifies a maximum time in seconds for connecting to the NOAA Atlas 14 data
    server. This option is typically a scalar, but may also use a vector with
    two elements. In this case, the first value is the timeout to connect with the
    server, and the second value is the time for the server to return the first byte.
    You can also set timeout to None, in which case API queries will never time out.
    This may be useful for some slow connections, but is generally not recommended as
    your code may hang indefinitely if the server fails to respond.
    ----------
    Inputs:
        lat: The latitude of the query point in decimal degrees
        lon: The longitude of the query point in decimal degrees on the interval [-180, 180]
        parent: The path to the parent folder where the file should be saved. Defaults
            to the current folder.
        name: The name for the downloaded file. Defaults to
            noaa-atlas14-<statistic>-<series>-<data>-<units>.csv
        overwrite: True to allow the downloaded file to replace an existing file.
            False (default) to not allow overwriting
        statistic: The type of PFE statistic to download. Options are "mean", "upper",
            "lower", and "all"
        data: The type of PFE values to download. Options are "intensity" and "depth"
        series: The type of time series to derive PFE values from. Options are

        units: The units that PFE values should use. Options are "metric" and "english"
        timeout: The maximum number of seconds to connect with the data server
