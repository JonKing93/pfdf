class Segments:

    Segments  Builds and manages a stream segment network
    ----------
    The Segments class is used to build and manage a stream segment network. Here,
    a stream segment is approximately equal to the stream bed of a catchment basin.
    The class constructor delineates an initial network. The class then provides
    methods to compute earth-system variables for the individual stream segments,
    and to filter the network to model-worthy segments. Other method compute
    inputs for hazard assessment models, and the "save" method exports results to
    standard GIS file formats. Please see the user guide for more detailed instructions
    on working with this class.

        Creates a new Segments object
        ----------
        Segments(flow, mask)
        Builds a Segments object to manage the stream segments in a drainage network.
        Note that stream segments approximate the river beds in the catchment basins,
        rather than the full catchment basins. The returned object records the
        pixels associated with each segment in the network.

        The stream segment network is determined using a TauDEM-style D8 flow direction
        raster and a raster mask (and please see the documentation of the pfdf.watershed
        module for details of this style). Note the the flow direction raster must have
        both a CRS and an affine Transform. The mask is used to indicate the pixels under
        consideration as stream segments. True pixels may possibly be assigned to a
        stream segment, False pixels will never be assigned to a stream segment. The
        mask typically screens out pixels with low flow accumulations, and may include
        other screenings - for example, to remove pixels in large bodies of water, or
        pixels below developed areas.

        Segments(..., max_length)
        Segments(..., max_length, units)
        Also specifies a maximum length for the segments in the network. Any segment
        longer than this length will be split into multiple pieces. The split pieces
        will all have the same length, which will be < max_length. Note that the
        max_length must be at least as long as the diagonal of the raster pixels.
        By default, this command interprets max_length in meters. Use the "units"
        option to specify max_length in different units instead. Unit options include:
        "base" (CRS/Transform base unit), "meters" (default), "kilometers", "feet",
        and "miles".
        ----------
        Inputs:
            flow: A TauDEM-style D8 flow direction raster
            mask: A raster whose True values indicate the pixels that may potentially
                belong to a stream segment.
            max_length: A maximum allowed length for segments in the network.
            units: Specifies the units of max_length. Options include:
                "base" (CRS base units), "meters" (default)", "kilometers", "feet",
                and "miles".

        Returns a numpy 1D array with one element per stream segment.

        If using one of the statistics that ignores NaN values (e.g. nanmean),

        When possible, we recommend only using the "outlet", "mean", "sum", "nanmean",
        and "nansum" statistics when computing summaries for every catchment basin.
        The remaining statistics require a less efficient algorithm, and so are much
        slower to compute. Alternatively, see below for an option to only compute
        statistics for terminal outlet basins - this is typically a faster operation,
        and more suitable for other statistics.

        Computes masked statistics over the catchment basins. True elements in the

        self.catchment_summary(..., terminal=True)
        Only computes statistics for the terminal outlet basins. The output will
        have one element per terminal segment. The order of values will match the
        order of IDs reported by the "Segments.termini" method. The number of
        terminal outlet basins is often much smaller than the total number of
        segments. As such, this option presents a faster alternative and is

        Computes the mean confinement angle for each stream segment. Returns these
        angles as a numpy 1D array. The order of angles matches the order of
        segment IDs in the object.

        The confinement angle for a given pixel is calculated using the slopes in the
        two directions perpendicular to stream flow. A given slope is calculated using
        the maximum DEM height within N pixels of the processing pixel in the
        associated direction. Here, the number of pixels searched in each direction
        (N) is equivalent to the "neighborhood" input. The slope equation is thus:

            slope = max height(N pixels) / (N * length)

        where length is one of the following:
            * X axis resolution (for flow along the Y axis)
            * Y axis resolution (for flow along the X axis)
            * length of a raster cell diagonal (for diagonal flow)
        Recall that slopes are computed perpendicular to the flow direction,
        hence the use X axis resolution for Y axis flow and vice versa.

        The confinment angle is then calculated using:

            theta = 180 - tan^-1(slope1) - tan^-1(slope2)

        and the mean confinement angle is calculated over all the pixels in the
        stream segment.

        Example:
        Consider a pixel flowing east with neighborhood=4. (East here indicates
        that the pixel is flowing to the next pixel on its right - it is not an
        indication of actual geospatial directions). Confinement angles are then
        calculated using slopes to the north and south. The north slope is
        determined using the maximum DEM height in the 4 pixels north of the
        stream segment pixel, such that:

            slope = max height(4 pixels north) / (4 * Y axis resolution)

        and the south slope is computed similarly. The two slopes are used to
        compute the confinement angle for the pixel, and this process is then
        repeated for all pixels in the stream segment. The final value for the
        stream segment will be the mean of these values.

        By default, this routine assumes that the DEM units are meters. If this
        is not the case, then use the "dem_per_m" to specify a conversion factor
        (number of DEM units per meter).

        Exports the network to a geojson.FeatureCollection object. The individual
        Features have LineString geometries whose coordinates proceed from upstream
        to downstream. Will have one feature per stream segment.

        self.geojson(type='basins')

        Note that you can use Segments.locate_basins to pre-locate the basins
        before calling this command. If not pre-located, then this command will
        locate the basins sequentially, which may take a while. Note that the

        outlet points, which will have one feature per segment in the network.

        self.geojson(..., properties)
        Specifies data properties for the GeoJSON features. The "properties" input
        should be a dict. Each key should be a string and will be interpreted as
        the name of the associated property field. Each value should be a numpy
        1D array with a boolean, integer, floating, or string dtype. Boolean
        values are converted to integers in the output GeoJSON object.

        If exporting segments or segment outlets, then each array should have one
        element per segment in the network. If exporting outlets or basins, each
        array may have either (1) one element per segment in the network, or (2)

        segment, extracts the values for the terminal segments prior to GeoJSON export.

        self.geojson(..., *, crs)

        By default, the method will attempt to guess the intended file format based
        on the path extensions, and will raise an Exception if the file format
        cannot be guessed. However, see below for a syntax to specify the driver,
        regardless of extension. You can use:

        segment, extracts the values for the terminal segments prior to saving.

        self.geojson(..., *, crs)
        Specifies the CRS of the output file. By default, uses the CRS of the flow
        direction raster used to derive the network. Use this option to export
        results in a different CRS instead.

        save(..., *, driver)
        Specifies the file format driver to used to write the vector feature file.
        Uses this format regardless of the file extension. You can call:
            >>> pfdf.utils.driver.vectors()
        to return a summary of file format drivers that are expected to always work.

        More generally, the pfdf package relies on fiona (which in turn uses GDAL/OGR)
        to write vector files, and so additional drivers may work if their
        associated build requirements are met. You can call:
