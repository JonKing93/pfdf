For example, you might use a mask to indicate pixels that should be included/ignored in an analysis.\n",

Setting this option to True indicates that a saved raster represents a boolean mask, rather than an integer data array.

If we rasterize the dataset without specifying a data field, then the `from_polygons` command ignores the data field, and interprets the dataset as a boolean raster mask. Plotting the example, we find that raster pixels within the polygons are marked as True (dark grey), and pixels outside the squares are marked as False (white):"

When this is the case, rasterizing the entire polygon dataset can require an excessive amount of memory. Instead, use the `bounds` option to only rasterize the polygon features that intersect the given bounding box. As with the `from_file` factory, the most common workflow is to use a second `Raster` object as the bounding box. However, you can also provide the bounds explicitly if known.\n",
