    "These tutorials are a series of [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) designed to introduce new users to pfdf's key components. The [main series](#Main-Series) demonstrates how to use pfdf to implement a hazard assessment, and there are [additional tutorials](#Advanced-Topics) for more advanced topics. We recommend starting with the main series, as this will introduce most of pfdf's core components. The main series should be followed in order, as most of the notebooks build off of previous concepts.\n",
