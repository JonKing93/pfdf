    "Raster datasets are fundamental to pfdf - many routines require rasters as input, and many produce new rasters as output. In brief, a raster dataset is a rectangular grid composed of _pixels_, which are rectangular cells with assigned data values. The pixels are regularly spaced along the X and Y axes, and each axis may use its own spacing interval. A raster is usually associated with some spatial metadata, which locates the raster's pixels in space. Some rasters will also have a NoData value - when this is the case, pixels equal to the NoData value represent missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A raster's spatial metadata consists of a coordinate reference system (CRS) and an affine transformation matrix (also known as the _transform_). The transform converts the data grid's column indices to spatial coordinates, and the CRS specifies the location of these coordinates on the Earth's surface. A transform defines a raster's resolution and alignment (the location of pixel edges) and takes the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{vmatrix}\n",
    "dx & 0 & \\mathrm{left}\\\\\n",
    "0 & dy & \\mathrm{top}\n",
    "\\end{vmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here _dx_ and _dy_ are the change in spatial coordinate when incrementing one column or row, and their absolute values define the raster's resolution. Meanwhile, _left_ and _top_ indicate the spatial coordinates of the data grid's left and top edges, which defines the raster's alignment. The two remaining coefficients can be used to implement shear transforms, but pfdf only supports rectangular pixels, so these will always be 0 for our purposes."
