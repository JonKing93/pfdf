Tutorials
=========

Welcome to the pfdf tutorials! The tutorials are intended to introduce new users to key components of pfdf, and are provided as a collection of `Jupyter notebooks <https://jupyter.org/>`_. We recommend starting with the :doc:`Main Series <main-series>`, which shows how to use pfdf to implement a hazard assessment. Users should follow the main series in order, as each notebook builds off of previous topics. 

The tutorials also include notebooks for various :doc:`Advanced Topics <advanced>`. These tutorials may be followed in any order, but most users will benefit from reading the main series first.

When possible, we recommend running the tutorials as live Jupyter notebooks, as this will allow you to interact with pfdf code directly. Please read the following pages for :doc:`setup instructions <download>`. Alternatively, if you are having trouble setting up the notebooks, you can instead read through :doc:`pre-run versions of the notebooks <main-series>` in these docs.

The tutorials are not exhaustive, and instead provide an initial look at pfdf. After completing the tutorials, users may be interested in reading the :doc:`User Guide </guide/index>`, which examines tutorial concepts in greater detail. Users may also want to consult the :doc:`API </api/index>`, which provides a complete reference guide to pfdf.
