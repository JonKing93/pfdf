    This module implements the combined relative hazard classification model presented in `Cannon et al., 2010 <https://doi.org/10.1130/B26459.1>`_. This model classifies debris-flow hazard by by considering both likelihood and potential sediment volume. In brief, the model classifies likelihood and volume hazards separately, and assigned a score to each class. These two scores are then added, and the combined score determines the final combined-hazard class.

    Workflow
    --------

    Most users will want to start with the :ref:`hazard <pfdf.models.cannon2010.hazard>` function. This function returns combined relative hazard classes for a set of debris flows, given the debris flow likelihoods and potential sediment volumes. Note that you can use the :ref:`staley2017 <pfdf.models.staley2017>` module to compute likelihoods, and the :ref:`gartner2014 <pfdf.models.gartner2014>` module to compute volumes, although the use of these modules is not strictly required.

    Advanced users may be interested in the :ref:`pscore <pfdf.models.cannon2010.pscore>`, :ref:`vscore <pfdf.models.cannon2010.vscore>`, and :ref:`hscore <pfdf.models.cannon2010.hscore>` functions, which calculate the individual (p)robability, (v)olume, and (h)azard scores. Some users may also be interested in changing the model configuration to implement custom hazard assessment thresholds. You can do so by providing the optional "thresholds" argument to any function.

    Thresholds
    ----------

    .. _c10-default-thresholds:

    The following table summarizes the default model thresholds, as presented in the paper:

    =====  ===========  ============  ======
    Class  Probability  Volume        Hazard
    =====  ===========  ============  ======
    1      [0, 0.25]    [0, 10^3]     1 - 3
    2      (0.25, 0.5]  (10^3, 10^4]  4 - 6
    3      (0.5, 0.75]  (10^4, 10^5]  > 7
    4      (0.75, 1]    > 10^5        N/A
    =====  ===========  ============  ======

    When providing custom thresholds for any portion of the analysis, the thresholds should be a vector of N increasing values, such that thresholds = :math:`[T_1, \ T_2, \ ..., \ T_n]`. Then, the relevant scores are assigned as follows:

    ========================  =====
    Values                    Score
    ========================  =====
    :math:`[0, \ T_1]`        1
    :math:`(T_1, \ T_2]`      2
    ...                       ...
    :math:`(T_{n-1}, \ T_n]`  N
    :math:`(T_n, \ âˆž]`        N+1
    ========================  =====

.. py:function:: hazard(likelihoods, volumes, *, p_thresholds = [0.25, 0.5, 0.75], v_thresholds = [1e3, 1e4, 1e5], h_thresholds = [3, 6])
    :module: pfdf.models.cannon2010

    Computes the combined relative hazard scores for a set of debris flows

    .. dropdown:: Classify Hazard

        ::

            hazard(likelihoods, volumes)

        Computes combined relative hazard classes, given a set of debris flow likelihoods and potential sediment volumes (meters^3). The shapes of the likelihood and volume arrays must be `broadcastable`_.

    .. dropdown:: Custom Thresholds

        ::     

            hazard(..., *, p_thresholds)
            hazard(..., *, v_thresholds)
            hazard(..., *, h_thresholds)

    
        Specify custom thresholds for the (p)robability, (v)olume, and (h)azard classification scores. Each set of thresholds must be a set of N positive values in an increasing order. Note that N defines the number of breakpoints, so the number of classifications will be N+1. Elements of p_thresholds must be on the interval from 0 to 1, v_thresholds must be positive, and h_thresholds must be positive integers.

        .. note:: Specifying v_thresholds relaxes the unit requirements for the input sediment volumes. When this is the case, v_thresholds and volumes must use the same units, but any units are permitted.

    :Inputs: * **likelihoods** (*ndarray*) -- An array of debris flow likelihoods. Values should be on the interval from 0 to 1.
             * **volumes** (*ndarray*) -- An array of debris flow volumes. If not specifying v_thresholds, then units should be meters^3. Otherwise, units should be the same as v_thresholds. The shape of this array must be `broadcastable`_ with the likelihoods array.
             * **p_thresholds** (*vector*) -- Custom thresholds for the likelihood scores. Elements must be on the interval 0 to 1, in ascending order.
             * **v_thresholds** (*vector*) -- Custom thresholds for the volume scores. Elements must be positive values, in ascending order.
             * **h_thresholds** (*vector*) -- Custom thresholds for the combined hazard classification. Elements must be positive integers, in ascending order.

    :Outputs: *ndarray* -- The combined relative hazard classifications for the debris flows. The shape of this array is the shape obtained by broadcasting the likelihood scores with the volume scores.

        .. note:: N is the number of breakpoints, so the number of classification groups will be N+1.

    :Inputs: * **combined** (*ndarray*) -- The combined relative hazard scores. This is the sum of the classification scores for likelihood and volume. NaN values are allowed and will receive a hazard class of NaN.
             * **thresholds** (*vector*) -- The thresholds to use to determine hazard classes. Should be a vector of N positive integers in ascending order.

    :Outputs: *ndarray* -- The combined hazard classifications
