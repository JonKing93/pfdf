Combined Hazard Classification
==============================

The ``cannon2010`` (or ``c10``) module provides functions to classify relative hazard based on debris-flow probability and potential sediment volume. This classification is a multi-part process. First, probabilities and volumes are divided into classes. Then, the probability and volume classes are added together for each debris-flow. Finally, these sums are divided into relative hazard classes.

You can use the ``hazard`` function to classify relative hazard. The function requires a set of debris-flow probabilities (on the interval from 0 to 1), and potential sediment volumes (in m^3). These inputs should be numpy arrays, and are often produced by the :doc:`staley2017 <s17>` and :doc:`gartner2014 <g14>` modules. For example::

    >>> from pfdf.models import s17, g14, c10
    >>> probabilities = s17.probability(...)
    >>> volumes = g14.emergency(...)
    >>> hazard = c10.hazard(probabilities, volumes)

By default, the function uses the following classification scheme:


.. list-table::

    * - **Class**
      - **Probability**
      - **Volume (m^3)**
      - **Combined Score**
    * - 1
      - [0, 0.25]
      - [0, 10^3]
      - 1-3
    * - 2
      - (0.25, 0.5]
      - (10^3, 10^4]
      - 4-6
    * - 3
      - (0.5, 0.75]
      - (10^4, 10^5]
      - >6
    * - 4
      - (0.75, 1]
      - >10^5
      - N/A


However, you can also use the "p_thresholds", "v_thresholds", and "h_thresholds" options to specify different thresholds for the (p)robability, (v)olume, and (h)azard classifications. For example::

    >>> hazard = c10.hazard(
            probabilities, 
            volumes, 
            p_thresholds=[.3, .6, .9],
            v_thresholds = [2E3, 2E4, 2E5],
            h_thresholds = [2,4,6],
        )

Advanced users may also be interested in the ``pscore`` and ``vscore`` functions, which return the individual probability and volume classes::

    >>> p = c10.pscore(probabilities)
    >>> v = c10.vscore(volumes)

And note that these functions also accept custom thresholds::

    >>> p = c10.pscore(probabilities, thresholds=[.3, .6, .9])
    >>> v = c10.vscore(volumes, threholds=[2E3, 2E4, 2E5])
