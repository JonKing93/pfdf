# pfdf

A Python library to facilitate postfire debris-flow hazard assessments.


## Summary

The pfdf (postfire debris-flow) package provides utilities intended to facilitate postfire debris-flow hazard assessments and research. The package contains routines to:

* Analyze watersheds
* Delineate and filter stream segment networks
* Compute earth-system variables for stream segments in a network
* Assess debris-flow probabilities using the models of Staley and others, 2017
* Assess potential sediment volumes using the models of Gartner and others, 2014
* Classify relative hazards using the methods of Cannon and others, 2010, and
* Export results to GeoJSON and common GIS file formats

Please see the [User Guide](https://ghsc.code-pages.usgs.gov/lhp/pfdf/) for detailed usage instructions, tutorials, and the API.
