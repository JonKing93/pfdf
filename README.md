# pfdf mirror

This repository is a mirror of the US Geological Survey's pfdf library. This mirror is intended as a backup in case the official USGS repository ever becomes unavailable. You should use the official repository if at all possible, and links to the official source are provided below:

* [Official USGS Repository](https://code.usgs.gov/ghsc/lhp/pfdf.git)
* [Documentation](https://ghsc.code-pages.usgs.gov/lhp/pfdf/)

Currently, this mirror does not implement (1) the documentation and (2) the `pip install` options of the USGS source. However if the USGS source becomes unavailable, then please [create an issue](https://github.com/JonKing93/pfdf/issues/new) on this mirror, and I will activate the missing functionality.
