# post-wildfire-debris-flow-hazard-assessment

A Python library to implement post-wildfire debris-flow hazard assessments.

## Status
This project is motivated by an unpublished collection of scripts written by Dennis Staley. The project is currently focused on adapting those scripts into a modern Python library.

Currently, the project is focused on modularizing the original code. Once this is done, additional work will need to:
  * open source the code
  * optimize runtimes
  * validate user inputs
  * provide comprehensive documentation
before the project should be considered for public release.

## Branches

main: This holds the current Python library. The code on this branch should be approved before merging.

original: This branch serves as a reference. It holds the original scripts that the project is based on.
